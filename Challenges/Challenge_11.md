## Welcome to Challenge 11

Welcome to the 11th Challenge!

Today's challenge is a re-practice of the 7th Challenge (https://github.com/srijoy-paul/git-github-Practice-repo/blob/main/Challenges/Challenge_7.md)

So the focus for this challenge will be to practice the ``git rebase`` command. I can still see in the pull request that it is having two commits than there should be; therefore, I give you a chance to correct them again. Keep only one commit on the pull request at this point in time.

Ensure to practice the ``git rebase`` command in your own local git repository. You can check out this guide: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-squash-explained/

Task: 
1. Practice git rebase, and how to squash commit using git rebase in your local projects 
2. Once done, try to squash the commits in your pull request in the Challenge repository

## Welcome to Challenge 14

Welcome to the 14th Challenge!

In this two-part challenge, we will try to emulate and fix merge conflicts via git.

Today is the first part of this challenge:

Task: 
1. Update your forked repo from the original repo. Also, ensure that your branch ``your-user-name-details`` is also synced with the latest changes from the original repository

2. In your branch ``your-user-name-details`` open and add your name to the list of challengers inside the ``challengers-list.md`` file by following the format in the file.

3. Push your change to reflect in the Pull Request created in previous challenges

## Welcome to Challenge 20

Welcome to the 20th Challenge 

So far, you have learned the basics of Git and Github.
Now it is super important to go through the contributing guidelines for any open-source project.

Most projects either come with a ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` file or might have details on how to make contributions to a project, whether it is through creation of an issue, or creating a Pull Request. 

Here are some resources for good practices for git branch naming conventions, pull request creation, and issue triaging:
1. https://codingsight.com/git-branching-naming-convention-best-practices/
2. https://tighten.com/blog/building-a-great-pull-request/


Task: 
Today's task is simple but super important: go through all these links and summarize what you learn about what needs to be done for effective open source contribution, especially with respect to open source issue creation and best practices around branch/pull request creation.

Add this as a comment in the issue created in prior challenges
